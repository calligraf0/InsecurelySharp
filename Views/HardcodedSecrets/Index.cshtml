    <h2 class="display-8">Overview</h2>
    <p>
        The use of a hard-coded password increases the possibility of password guessing tremendously.
    </p>


    <h2 class="display-8">Likelihood of exploitation</h2>
    <p>
        The use of a hard-coded password has many negative implications - the most significant of these being a failure of authentication measures under certain circumstances.<br />
        On many systems, a default administration account exists which is set to a simple default password which is hard-coded into the program or device. This hard-coded password is the same for each device or system of this type and often is not changed or disabled by end users.<br />
        If a malicious user comes across a device of this kind, it is a simple matter of looking up the default password (which is freely available and public on the internet) and logging in with complete access.<br />

        In systems which authenticate with a back-end service, hard-coded passwords within closed source or drop-in solution systems require that the back-end service use a password which can be easily discovered.<br />
        Client-side systems with hard-coded passwords propose even more of a threat, since the extraction of a password from a binary is exceedingly simple.

    <h2 class="display-8">Risks</h2>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Depending on how the application is designed this may lead to different impacts</li>
            <li>On client side applications, this facilitates the exploitation of users</li>
            <li>On server side applications, this increses the likelihood of an attacker compromising other systems or escalates privileges</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h2 class="display-8">How to protect yourself</h2>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>During the design of the application rather than hard code a default username and password for first time logins, utilize a “first login” mode which requires the user to enter a unique strong password.</li>
            <li>Generate a strong, unique password using safe random functions and display it to the user in a safe way, later ask to change such password. (<b>DO NOT</b> use mac addresses or other easily guessable IDs :) )</li> 
        </ul>
